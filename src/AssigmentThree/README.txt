So there were alot of diffrent opinion and unclear directions regardining how this problem should be approched and what
 is expected of us, However we belive that our problem properly demonstrates the Composite as well as Interince across
 Objects as well as abstract classes. The item class should never be instaianted yet contians important methods for the
 program. This structure creates the need to create a type of item before it can be added. Movable Objects comiate with the world the
 inhib in order to be move and autonomus objects have a step method that call their own instance of move in a random di-
  rection through the step method. The world also ahs an compsite method that lets us call the step method for
   all of the autonomous objects in the world.
